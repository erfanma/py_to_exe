# py_to_exe
this module converts a python program to an executable one



the app asks you several question:
1- about the modules that your project include which are not in the python standard library.
   if you are too tired to type all of your modules you can just use pip freez command to
   creating a file of all modules and then give the program a path to that .txt file.
2- location of your project
3- name of your main file that you want to convert to .exe
4- at last a simple yes or no promission

and during the procces you can see every step in the prompt
enjoy!
